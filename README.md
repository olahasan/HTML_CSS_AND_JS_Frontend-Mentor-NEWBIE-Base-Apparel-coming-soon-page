## Overview

### The challenge

This layout looks simple enough, but there are some interesting details to it that will test your CSS skills. You'll also get to practice basic form validation.

Your users should be able to:

- Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
  - The input field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
